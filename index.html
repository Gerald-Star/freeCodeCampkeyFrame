            <h5>How the CSS @keyframes and animation Properties Work</h5>


            <p>The animation properties control how the animation should behave 
                
                and the @keyframes rule controls what happens during that 
                animation.
            </p>
                <br> <hr>
                
            <p>There are eight animation properties in total. 
                The two most important ones first:

                <br> <br>
                <strong>1. Animation-name </strong>sets the name of the animation, which is later used by @keyframes to tell CSS which rules go with which animations.
                which is later used by @keyframes to tell CSS which rules go with
                 which animations.
                <br> <br>
                <strong>2  Animation-duration </strong> sets the length of time 
                    for the animation.
            </p>
            <br> <hr>
            <h5>keyframes</h5>

            <p> @keyframes is how to specify exactly what happens within the animation 
                over the duration. This is done by giving CSS properties for specific 
                "frames" during the animation, with percentages ranging from 0% to 100%.
                <br> <br>

                If you compare this to a movie, the CSS properties for 0% is how the element
                 displays in the opening scene. The CSS properties for 100% is how the 
                 element appears at the end, right before the credits roll.

                 <br>
                  Then CSS applies the magic to transition the element over the 
                  given duration to act out the scene. Here's an example to illustrate the
                   usage of @keyframes and the animation properties:
            </p>

        <section>
            <p>Create an animation for the element with the id rect, 
                by setting the animation-name to rainbow and the animation-duration to 4 
                seconds. Next, declare a @keyframes rule, and set the background-color 
                at the beginning of the animation (0%) to blue, the middle of the animation 
                (50%) to green, and the end of the animation (100%) to yellow
            </p>
